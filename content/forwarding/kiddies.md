Big D!

Your "Save the Kiddies" foundation idea is going great. Can you believe
people are actually donating to this scam? We're drawing in almost as much
money from these suckers as we're getting from the meth. Even some of the
girls you are pimping pitched in. Ha!

By the way, we need more muscle for our protection racket. More marks are
refusing payment, and they need some "convincing."
